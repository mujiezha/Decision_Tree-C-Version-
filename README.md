# Decision_Tree-C-Version-
Realize Decision Tree  of ID3 using C++
In this exercise, I predict whether you will have a good night-out in Jerusalem for the coming New Year's Eve. 
Assume that you have kept a record of your previous night-outs with the following attributes.
• How densely the place is usually occupied {High, Moderate, Low}
• How the prices are {Expensive, Normal, Cheap}
• Volume of the music {Loud, Quiet}
• The location {Talpiot, City-Center, Mahane-Yehuda, Ein-Karem, German-Colony}
• Whether you are a frequent customer (VIP) {Yes, No}
• Whether this place has your favorite beer {Yes, No}
• Whether you enjoyed {Yes, No}
We have provided a data file (dt-data.txt) that contains the relevant records.

program file: main.cpp
to construct decision trees based on the idea of splitting by Information Gain.

decision Tree structure: BDTree.txt

prediction output:
Make a prediction for (occupied = Moderate; price = Cheap; music = Loud; location = City-Center; VIP = No; favorite beer = No).
